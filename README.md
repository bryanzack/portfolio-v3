## Portfolio project using React.js, Next.js, Redux, and Typescript

This project was meant to help me learn popular web development frameworks as well as to create something I can share with potential employers.

### Portfolio

The actual portfolio is on the home page, though I did play around with data fetching techniques using Redux Toolkit Query. If you visit https://www.bryanzack.com/league, you will find that you are able to type in any League of Legends user and search their match history.
